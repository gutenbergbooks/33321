<h1>TWO PLAYS FOR DANCERS</h1>

<h1>TWO PLAYS FOR DANCERS</h1>

<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>In a note at the end of my last book 'The Wild
Swans at Coole' (Cuala Press.) I explained why I
preferred this kind of drama, and where I had found
my models, and where and how my first play after
this kind was performed, and when and how I would
have it performed in the future. I can but refer the
reader to the note or to the long introduction to
'Certain Noble Plays of Japan' (Cuala Press.)</p>

<p style='text-align: right'>W. B. Yeats. October 11th. 1918</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>P. S. That I might write 'The Dreaming of the
Bones,' Mr. W. A. Henderson with great kindness
wrote out for me all historical allusions to Dervorgilla.</p>

<p>The stage is any bare place in a room close to the
wall. A screen with a pattern of mountain and sky
can stand against the wall, or a curtain with a like
pattern hang upon it, but the pattern must only
symbolize or suggest. One musician enters and then
two others, the first stands singing while the others
take their places. Then all three sit down against
the wall by their instruments, which are already
there&mdash;a drum, a zither, and a flute. Or they unfold
a cloth as in 'The Hawk's Well,' while the instruments
are carried in.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="r0">(or all three musicians, singing)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why does my heart beat so?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did not a shadow pass?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It passed but a moment ago.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who can have trod in the grass?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What rogue is night-wandering?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have not old writers said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That dizzy dreams can spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the dry bones of the dead?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a night it seems<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all the valley fills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With those fantastic dreams.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They overflow the hills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So passionate is a shade,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p002" id="Page_p002">[Pg 2]</a></span><span class="i0">Like wine that fills to the top<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A grey-green cup of jade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or maybe an agate cup.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(speaking) The hour before dawn and the moon covered up.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The little village of Abbey is covered up;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The little narrow trodden way that runs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the white road to the Abbey of Corcomroe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is covered up; and all about the hills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are like a circle of Agate or of Jade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Somewhere among great rocks on the scarce grass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Birds cry, they cry their loneliness.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even the sunlight can be lonely here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even hot noon is lonely. I hear a footfall&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A young man with a lantern comes this way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He seems an Aran fisher, for he wears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flannel bawneen and the cow-hide shoe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stumbles wearily, and stumbling prays.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>(A young man enters, praying in Irish)</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Once more the birds cry in their loneliness,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The wind has blown my lantern out. Where are you?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And lost them after, but you are in the right<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I should not be afraid in County Clare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And should be or should not be have no choice,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Noble or peasant to his burial.<br /></span>
